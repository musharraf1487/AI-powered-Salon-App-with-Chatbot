# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

Key Features I Built:

💬 Conversational AI Interface: Integrated Google’s Gemini API to enable intelligent, context-aware chat interactions.

🔍 Smart Service Recommendations: Implemented NLP logic to understand user needs and suggest personalized grooming or skincare treatments.

🗓 Real-Time Booking System: Built a booking flow allowing users to check available slots, book, reschedule, or cancel appointments seamlessly.

🧠 Behavior-Based ML Suggestions: Designed backend logic that learns from client interaction history to make future recommendations.

❓ Automated FAQ Engine: Preloaded the chatbot with complete salon data (services, hours, pricing, policies) to handle queries instantly — with no fallback to human agents.

🌐 Responsive Chat UI: Developed a clean, mobile-friendly chat widget using React, styled to match the salon’s brand identity.

🔒 100% Automated Workflow: Ensured the bot responds confidently to every user query using structured data and AI, without ever needing manual support.
