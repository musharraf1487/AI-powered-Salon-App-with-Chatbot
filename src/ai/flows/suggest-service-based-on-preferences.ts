Given the following information about the user:

Hair Type: {{#if hairType}}{{{hairType}}}{{else}}Not specified{{/if}}
Skin Type: {{#if skinType}}{{{skinType}}}{{else}}Not specified{{/if}}
Preferences: {{{preferences}}}

Suggest a list of services that would be most suitable for them. Also, provide a brief reasoning for why you are suggesting these services.

Output the services as a JSON array of strings, and the reasoning as a plain text string.

Example:
{
  "suggestedServices": ["Haircut", "Facial"],
  "reasoning": "Haircut is a good option for all hair types. Facial is a great option for improving the skin condition."
}

Make sure the suggested services are always a valid service that Glow Haus offers, which include: Haircuts, Facials, Manicures, Bridal Makeup, Massage, Threading, Waxing, Skin Treatments.
